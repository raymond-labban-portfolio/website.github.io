          <p>My creative work falls under four categories: Conceptual design, Graphic design, Web design, and Game design. I believe that when artists create something that represents their inner thoughts and perspectives, their work becomes much more interesting and intriguing. This is why I use each of these different categories to express my inner self in a specific way.</p>
	<p>Whenever I do work in Conceptual design, my thoughts start to form, and I use my imagination to bring my visions to fruition. My process involves either drawing on a piece of paper or using my drawing tablet to draw something on my computer. I do this so I can show off my ideas before I turn them into a work of art. I do this whenever I do any form of design whether it’s Graphic, Web, or Game art. I do this beforehand in order to present a foundation for any project I would work on for any of those other three design categories.</p>
	<p>If I’m doing work involving Graphic design, more often then not, I’ll use what I create as artwork that I put on a poster, newsletter, or website that I’m working on. What I’ll do is use my imagination to come up with artwork that would correlate with the theme of my project as a whole and elevate the appeal.</p>
	<p>If I’m doing work involving Web design, I’m mainly focused on putting all of the information that I can fit on the website while making it appealing to look at. My goal for any website I build is to make each one as crisp as possible.<p>
	<p>If I’m doing work involving Game design, I mostly stress about how the game is going to look and feel as a whole. I will make sure that everything fits perfectly with one another. Everything from the art, the graphics, the sound, the music, the script, the dialogue, to the gameplay itself.</p>
<p>That’s everything when it comes to the process of how I create my works of art. I think the reason why this method works for me is because it was just a habit that I fell into. I never wanted to change how I did things. Because of that, I can spend my days creating art that I want to make and put it out for the world to see.</p>
