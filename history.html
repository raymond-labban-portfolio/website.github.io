          <p>
            In order to give my career in Web Development and Graphic Design the boost it needs for me to gain more clients, I founded RayLab Web Services LLC and became it's Sole Proprietor. Because of this, I developed a fully programmed website that includes information about my company, my portfolio, and a way to get into contact with me to enlist my freelance services.
         </p>
          <p>
            For this website, I am the webmaster. Which means I am the one who is in charge of everything about it. My responsibilities include, but aren't limited to, updating the code (HTML/CSS/JavaScript/Python/PHP). I also manage the content and how it looks and is presented.
         </p>
          <p>
            My workflow process starts with me editing the code in the Atom IDE with the window open on the left half of the screen, and the website preview window on the right half of the screen. This way, I can get immediate feedback on my code, and make sure I achieved the desired results. Once I'm satisfied with the edits I made to the source code in Atom IDE, I make the edits public by copying & pasting the new code into my website's repository; with GitHub as the Web Hosting service.
